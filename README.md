# Sports-Person-Image-Classification

In this data science and machine learning project, we classify sports personalities. We restrict classification to only 5 people:


- Maria Sharapova
- Serena Williams
- Virat Kohli
- Roger Federer
- Lionel Messi

Here is the folder structure:

- UI: This contains UI website code
- server: Python Flask server
- model: Contains Python notebook for model building
- google_image_scrapping: Code to scrap Google for images
- images_dataset: Dataset used for our model training

Technologies used in this project:

- Python
- Numpy and OpenCV for data cleaning
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
- Sklearn for model building
- Jupyter notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm as IDE
- Python Flask for HTTP server
- HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI

## Running the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `server` directory:
2. Run the Flask server by executing `server.py`:
3. Open another terminal window and navigate to the `model` directory:
4. Run the Python notebook `wavelet.py`:
5. Once the notebook is open, execute all cells to build the model.
6. Finally, navigate to the `UI` directory and open `app.html` in a web browser to interact with the project UI.
Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed before running the project.
